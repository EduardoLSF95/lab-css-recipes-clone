    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul class="ulzinho">
    <p class="textinho2">
      1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br> 
      flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br> 
      temperature and let simmer. <br>
      2) Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a <br>
      lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br>
      that it does not run off. <br>
      3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br>
      degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
